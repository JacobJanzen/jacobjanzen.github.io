## Completed Projects

### [Writhing Mass of Flesh](https://github.com/JacobJanzen/writhing_mass_of_flesh)

This was a generative art project for the University of Manitoba's
.devClub Generative Art Challenge. This used Worley noise and Voronoi diagrams
to create bubbles that look decidedly fleshy. Originally I was writing this one in C,
but I ended up switching to Rust to make it more portable.

This project ended up winning the Generative Art Challenge in the Best Code category!

### [Space Cowboy](https://jacobjanzen.itch.io/space-cowboy)

This is a vertical platformer that I built with several other students for the University of
Manitoba Computer Science Student Association 2022 Game Jam. The theme for the event was "space",
so in this game, the goal is to climb to space. I mainly worked on the player movement and
ended up coming across a bug that ended up becoming a core feature of the game, where if the
player collides with the side of an object, they will gain rotational and vertical momentum
which can be used to make large jumps.

### [J5-Pocket-Monsters-Database](https://github.com/JacobJanzen/J5-Pocket-Monsters-Database)

![Database Interface](assets/db.png)

This was a project that I did with a couple other students for a course on databases which
allows the user to perform many queries on various information about Pokémon Emerald.
This project had a front end written in Vue.js and a back end in Python with the Flask
framework which interacted with a Sqlite database. In this project, I personally performed
much of the database design and data collection from the Pokémon wiki:
[Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page).

## In Progress

### [Pong](https://github.com/JacobJanzen/pong)

I'm have started implementing Pong in C using the SDL library. I am currently taking a break from
this one for a while.
